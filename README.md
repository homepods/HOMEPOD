# HOMEPOD

Build something extraordinary

HOMEPOD® is a product which helps self-builders to evaluate, design and build, sustainable homes.
The platform which we are building allows smart homes to transform, travel, reduce carbon, consume less energy and above all, to be self-sufficient in space.

<b>Colour</b></br>
Colour has an ability to influence our mood and our dealings with others. Identifying products by using their colour as a primary filter.

<b>Localization</b></br>
Sustainability is a key measure which helps to mitigate climate change. Local products by local people to drive more sustainable choices.

<b>Labels</b></br>
Knowing what goes where and when saves valuable time. Easy to identify in complex project workloads to help mitigate the operational risk.

<b>Project Management</b></br>
Modular and scalable operations from procurement, on-site and off-site components. Removing bottlenecks helps to mitigate risk.

<b>Vector Autoregression</b></br>
BIG data is complex and most often mistakes happen. In depth analysis of products and their supply chain opens new patterns to mitigate risk.

<b>Vector Autoregression</b></br>
The brain of the building learns to automate the buildings in mobility and space efficiency. Great for smart cities and outer space colonies.

<b>Our commitment to power sustainability through social responsibility.</b></br>
Building a sustainable culture is hard work. To develop trust with local producers we support local entrepreneurs to build this for us. In exchange we offer 70% of the margin from the retail price and the wholesale price. This is a 70% commission which one entrepreneur earns when their product is being acquired through the HOMEPOD platform.

<b>- Our mission - </b></br>
Our mission is to create buildings which build, maintain and recycle autonomously. This will help people to live healthy and to reduce their carbon footprint, so they can colonise other planets with greater efficiency.

<b> HOMEPOD® is a robotic process automation software which assembles sustainable homes. Our platform enables autonomous manufacturing, in land or in space.</b></br>
